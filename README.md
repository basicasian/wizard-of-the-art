# Wizard of ARt  

**Wizard of ARt** is an immersive AR spell-casting game created during **Hackathon Junction 2025** in under 48 hours.  
You play as a wizard devoted to **AI-generated magic** and **augmented reality**, tasked with fighting against human-made memes—such as Pepes—by casting dynamically generated spells using hand gestures.

## Project Overview  

Wizard of ARt explores the intersection of **AI-generated 3D content**, **AR immersion**, and **gesture-based interaction**.  
Players use AR glasses to cast spells using natural gestures—pinches, grabs, and directional targeting—while battling waves of meme-shaped enemies.

At startup, the game generates 3D spell models using Snap3D based on AI prompts.  
Hand gestures then summon and launch these spells into the AR world.

### Key Features  
- **AI-Generated Spell Assets** (Fire, Water, etc.)  
- **Gesture-Based Combat**  
- **Real-Time AR Projection**  
- **Enemy Waves Based on Human Memes**  
- **Built in <48 hours**

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open in **Lens Studio**.  
3. Assign script inputs in the Inspector (gesture script, UI, camera, health, spawner…).  
4. Build & deploy to AR glasses.

## Technical Highlights  

### 🧙 AI-Generated Spell Models  
Powered by **Snap3D**, spell assets are generated dynamically when the game begins.  
Examples:  
- Fire spell model  
- Water spell model  

Each spell model is instantiated, scaled, and positioned in real time.

### 🎯 Gesture-Driven Casting  
The game listens to pinch and grab events to spawn spell projectiles in the player’s forward direction.

### 💥 Spell Physics  
Each spell moves forward with a lifespan timer and collider for interactions.
